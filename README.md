# Data Scientist Nanodegree  
## Supervised Learning  
### Project: Finding Donors for CharityML  

### Overview  

This project is my customized version of the **Finding Donors for CharityML** project, completed as part of my Data Scientist Nanodegree. Using supervised learning techniques, I built a predictive model to identify potential donors for CharityML, a fictional nonprofit organization. The goal was to use a modified census dataset to accurately classify individuals likely to donate, optimizing model performance and interpretability.  

### Installation  

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

To execute the code, an installation of [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) is also necessary. An easy way to obtain all required packages is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a pre-packaged distribution of Python that includes these libraries and Jupyter Notebook.

### Code  

The project is implemented in the `finding_donors.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, the project uses two supplementary files: 
- `visuals.py` - for data visualization functions.
- `census.csv` - containing the dataset used to train and evaluate the models.

### Run  

To run this project, navigate to the project's directory in your terminal and use one of the following commands:

``` bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

### Data

The project utilizes a modified version of the census income dataset, containing about 32,000 data points with 13 features each. This dataset is based on the original dataset from the paper, *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid"* by Ron Kohavi. You can access the original dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
